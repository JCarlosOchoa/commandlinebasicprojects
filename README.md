# PyProjects

# This folder contains some of the basic projects I have completed in Python. None of these projects are super substantial, so I put them all together. 
# The focus is on having some fun rediscovering coding. Below is a description of each of the completed projects and a shortlist of incomplete snippets.


Completed:

1. Madlibs
  The goal: code a simple version of Madlibs where the user provided part of speech inputs through the terminal to fill in a Madlibs.
- I left this one half-baked. Instead of creating an entire collection of Madlibs from which to randomly choose, I left it at ONE example.


2. Rock-Paper-Scissors
The goal: play a text-version of rock-paper-scissors with the program.

  Inputs: user's choice of rock, paper, or scissors \
  Outputs: a string declaring the results

- The program asks the user to input their choice of rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer randomly chooses from one of the same options.
- Using a simple function to check if the user won, lost, or tied, the program returns a string declaring the results.


3. Guessing Game with Numbers (Two Versions) :  a. Version 1 being the program choosing a number and the user guessing ; b. Version 2 being the user choosing a number and the program guessing
  The goal: play a guessing game with the program. \

  VERSION 1 \
    Inputs: the highest number the program can choose \
    Outputs: a string declaring that the game ended once the number is correctly guessed
  
  - The program will randomly choose a number between 1 and the input value and the user will iteratively guess that number, receiving hints of "too big" or "too small."
  
    VERSION 2 \
    Inputs: the highest number the program can guess from \
    Outputs: a string declaring that the game ended once the number is correctly guessed
  
  - The user mentally will randomly choose a number between 1 and the input value and the program will iteratively guess that number, \ 
  receiving hints of "too big" or "too small," inputted by the user through the terminal.
  
  
  4. Text-Based Hangman
    The goal: guess the letters of a randomly chosen words before you run out of attempts (lives) \
    
    Inputs: n/a, we want the game to run without inputs 
    Outputs: a string telling the user whether or not they have guessed the mystery word correctly
    
 - The program will randomly choose one word from a large list of words and display to the user the number of attempts they have to guess the letters of the mystery word, \
 what letters have already been guessed by the user, and the state of the game, reflected in blanks and blanks replaced with letters as they have been guessed correctly.
